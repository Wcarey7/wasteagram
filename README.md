# wasteagram
CS 492 Mobile Software Development Project 5:

Build an application for recording food waste. Practice applying the concepts of location services, camera / image picker, permissions, forms, navigation, lists, asynchronous programming, streams, and Firebase backend services. Enhance your application with analytics, crash reporting, accessibility, internationalization, debugging and automated testing.
 
Implement Wasteagram, a mobile app that enables coffee shop employees to document daily food waste in the form of "posts" consisting of a photo, number of leftover items, the current date, and the location of the device when the post is created. The application should also display a list of all previous posts.

# Learning Outcomes
    1. Obtain device location information and integrate the use of the camera or photo gallery.
    2. Demonstrate persistence with remote storage services, such as Firebase Cloud Storage and a Firestore database. 
    3. Invoke asynchronous methods, employ navigation, capture form data, and display data in ListView components and detail screens. 
    4. Implement unit tests to validate application behavior. 
    5. Incorporate the Semantics widget to facilitate accessibility features of native platforms. 
    6. Demonstrate the use of analytics, crash reporting, and debugging tools.
